⚠️ CRITICAL SYNCHRONIZATION RULE ⚠️

DASHBOARD FILES MUST ALWAYS BE SYNCHRONIZED:

├── public/dashboard.html (SOURCE)
└── dashboard.html (ROOT - MUST MATCH ALWAYS)

SYNC COMMAND:
  cp /home/runner/workspace/public/dashboard.html /home/runner/workspace/dashboard.html

VERIFY SYNC:
  md5sum /home/runner/workspace/public/dashboard.html /home/runner/workspace/dashboard.html
  (Must show identical MD5 hashes)

WHEN TO SYNC:
  ✓ After ANY dashboard.html changes
  ✓ Before deployment
  ✓ Before pushing to GitHub
  ✓ Before restarting workflows

NEVER DELETE dashboard.html - IT IS CRITICAL FOR DEPLOYMENT
